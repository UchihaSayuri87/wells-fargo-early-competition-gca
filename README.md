# Wells Fargo Project Proposal

Project for Wells Fargo Early Competition x Global Career Accelerator

## How to Preview

1. Start a simple HTTP server:
   ```
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
2. Open the preview in your browser:
   ```
   $BROWSER http://localhost:8080
   ```

## How to Edit

- Edit `index.html` for structure and content.
- Edit `style.css` for styles.
- Edit `script.js` for interactivity.

## Learning Goals

- Understand semantic HTML structure.
- Learn how to use Bootstrap for layout and components.
- Practice writing accessible and well-commented code.
- Experiment with CSS parallax effects and responsive design.
- Add simple JavaScript for interactivity.

## Error Checking

To periodically check for errors during development, consider:
- Validating your HTML and CSS using online validators (e.g., [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)).
- Checking the browser console for JavaScript errors.

## Prompt Ideas

Here are some ideas to help you get started or extend the project:

- Add a new section to the proposal (e.g., "Risks", "Budget", or "Team").
- Change the background images or try different parallax effects.
- Make the site more interactive with JavaScript (e.g., add a modal, alert, or dynamic content).
- Improve accessibility by adding more ARIA roles or keyboard navigation.
- Customize the color scheme or typography in `style.css`.
- Add a form to the Contact section and handle its submission with JavaScript.
- Use Bootstrap components (like navbars, accordions, or carousels) to enhance the layout.
- Add animations or transitions to elements on scroll.
- Validate the HTML and CSS and fix any issues found.
- Document your changes and explain your reasoning in the Student Notes section.

Feel free to come up with your own ideas and experiment!
