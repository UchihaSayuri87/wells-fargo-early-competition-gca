## 📁 Project Structure

- `custom.css` — Custom styles for layout, animation, and UI
- `custom.js` — All interactive JavaScript (animations, modal, scrollspy, etc.)

## 🛠️ Customization

- Edit `index.html` for content and structure.
- Edit `custom.css` for styles and branding.
- Edit `custom.js` for static interactivity (if needed).
- Add or update sections (e.g., FAQ, Deliverables, Timeline) as needed.
- **Analytics:** Set the Google Analytics ID via the `UA-XXXXX-Y` placeholder in `public/index.html` or remove the script if not needed.
- **Images:** Optimize all images, use descriptive `alt` text, and use `loading="lazy"` for non-critical images.
- **Translations:** Update the language switcher and translation object in `src/App.js` to add or refine languages.

---

## 🧹 Maintenance & Testing

- Remove unused CSS/JS regularly to keep the codebase clean.
- Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for unit/component tests.
- Use [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) or browser extensions for accessibility checks.
- Test with a screen reader and keyboard navigation.

---

## ♿ Accessibility & Best Practices

- Uses semantic HTML5 elements and ARIA labels
- All images have descriptive `alt` text
- Keyboard and screen reader friendly navigation and forms
- Skip link for accessibility

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The build folder will contain all static files ready for deployment

3. Upload the contents of the `build/` folder to your hosting provider

### GitHub Pages Setup

Make sure GitHub Pages is configured in your repository settings:
- Go to Settings > Pages
- Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
- Select the `gh-pages` branch and `/` (root) folder
- Save the settings

### Alternative Hosting

You can also deploy to other static hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages by uploading the contents of the `build/` folder.
